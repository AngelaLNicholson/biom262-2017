You can download both raw and fully processed data. For our learning purposes, we will download the raw data (fastq). Let's take a look at knockdown of U2AF1 in K562 cells (data [here](https://www.encodeproject.org/experiments/ENCSR342EDG/)). When you have found the link to the fastq files, right click on it and select \"copy Link Address\". \n",
