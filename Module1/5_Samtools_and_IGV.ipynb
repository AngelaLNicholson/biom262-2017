    "\n",
    "Check out the samtools [documentation](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html). Since BAM files are binary, they can only be read by the computer. Samtools is a great tool that lets us view the contents of bamfiles and perform various manipulations on them. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Q: Remember we downloaded samtools on day 1. How do you check if it downloaded and what version you are running?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Try out some of the samtools commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "    samtools view interesting_file.bam (or intersting_file.sam)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    samtools flagstat insteresting_file.bam\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need to use samtools to sort and index the bam file. Work with your partner to figure out how you would sort a bam file and save it to a new file with the extension .sorted.bam\n",
    "\n",
    "    samtools sort -@ 8 -o interesting_file.sorted.bam interesting_file.bam \n",
    "    \n",
    "We also need a bai index of the sorted bam file. Again, work with your partner to determine what that command would look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "    samtools index interesting_file.sorted.bam\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have figured out what the commands should be, write a submitter script with both of those commands that you can submit for the file you made. The sorting takes 8 processors, so we need to submit a job. Keep in mind that you can include two commands in the same script. Just put one below the other and your second one will run after the first one is finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is just for practice on the bam file you made. I have done this already on the bam files provided so you can view them on IGV.\n",

    "Check out the IGV [website](https://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/) to download the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the downloads page scroll down to \"Binary Distribution\" and click \"Download Binary Distribution\". You are going to load IGV from your desktop, NOT TSCC. Move the downloaded file into some meaningful directory for you.\n",

    "In order to view alignments, you need to upload the bam files to an external server (not TSCC) for viewing. You can also download the bam and the indexed bai files to your desktop and load them from there. But since the files are big, I have uploaded them to an external server for you to view. I have uploaded four files in total, two for each condition (control and knockdown).\n",

    "\n",
    "You can leave the index field blank. By default the program searches in the same location for another file by the same name with the extension .bai. I have uploaded these files as well, so IGV will find them by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have uploaded all 4 files, play around by viewing different genes or chromosome locations. Can you see genes that clearly have fewer reads in the knockdown vs control datasets? What does U2AF1 look like? What about another family member U2AF2? \n",
    "\n",
    "We will come back to these later on for the initial pass that our most highly differetially expressed genes show expression differences.   \n",
    "\n",
    "When you are ready to quit IGV, you can save the session with File - Save session. Next time you open IGV you can open your saved session without having to reload the BAM files. "
